# Azure-secuirty
In today’s cloud-first world, securing workloads, data, and identities on Azure is a critical responsibility for organizations of all sizes. Azure Security encompasses the tools, services, and best practices designed to protect resources hosted on Microsoft Azure against threats, breaches, and unauthorized access. As an Azure Security Engineer, your role is to implement, manage, and monitor security controls, respond to incidents, and ensure compliance across cloud environments.

This section will focus on all the key domains and capabilities aligned with the Microsoft AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies certification, which validates the skills required to design and implement secure Azure solutions. These topics represent the foundation for hands-on projects, real-world implementations, and exam preparation.

We will explore Azure security across four major domains:

1. Manage Identity and Access
2. Implement Platform Protection 
3. Manage Security Operations
4. Secure Data, Applications, and Workloads

In the upcoming sections, we will dive deep into each of these domains—exploring practical security configurations, step-by-step setups, real-world scenarios, and hands-on Azure security projects that can be implemented to strengthen an organization’s cloud security posture. Whether the goal is to pass the AZ-500 exam, secure production workloads, or build a professional portfolio, mastering these topics is essential for success as an Azure Security Engineer.
