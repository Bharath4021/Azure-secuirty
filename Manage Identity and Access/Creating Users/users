In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a user is an identity that can be used to authenticate and access resources in Azure, Microsoft 365, and connected apps/services.
A user account contains credentials (username + password or other authentication methods) and attributes (like name, email, department, role).
**Users in Azure AD can be**:
- 1. Member users → Belong to your Azure AD tenant (e.g., your company employees).
- 2. Guest users → External people invited to collaborate (B2B collaboration).
- 3. Service accounts → Identities for applications or automated processes (often implemented as service principals).
**Why We Use Users in Azure**: Users are at the core of Azure’s identity and access model. We use them to:
- 1. Authenticate → Verify that someone (or something) is who they claim to be.
- 2. Authorize → Grant appropriate permissions to access resources using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- 3. Apply security controls → Enforce policies like MFA, Conditional Access, and Identity Protection.
- 4. Track activity → Audit sign-ins, access requests, and resource usage for compliance and security monitoring.
- 5. Collaborate securely → Share resources with external partners without giving them full control.
