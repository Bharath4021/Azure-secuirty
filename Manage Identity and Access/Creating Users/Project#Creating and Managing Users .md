# Project : Creating and Managing Users in Entra ID
## Introduction
Entra ID is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service that enables secure sign-in and access control for users, devices, and applications. In enterprise environments, managing users effectively is critical to ensure the right people have the right access at the right time.

Mastering this process ensures compliance, security, and operational efficiency for organizations using Azure services.
